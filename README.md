
# Task Manager CLI Application

A simple command-line interface (CLI) application to manage tasks. This application allows users to add, view, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with the ability to save and load tasks to/from a file for persistent storage.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Add a new task to the task list with a unique ID.
- **View Tasks**: View all tasks with their ID and status (completed or not).
- **Delete Task**: Delete a specific task by its ID.
- **Mark Task as Complete**: Update the status of a task to indicate it is completed.
- **Save and Load Tasks**: Automatically saves tasks to a JSON file (`tasks.json`) on exit and loads existing tasks on startup.
